# AI Accountability Partner Lite — Marketplace Listing Copy

**Product name**
AI Accountability Partner Lite

**One-liner**
Personalized, AI-crafted micro-coaching messages delivered to your Whop chat whenever you finish lessons or set goals — stay consistent without the overhead.

**Who it’s for**
- Creators launching courses on Whop
- Coaches and educators who want to increase student completion and engagement
- Solopreneurs and builders who need gentle, automated accountability nudges

**Why it helps**
Many learners start strong and lose momentum. Short, friendly check-ins with one micro-action increase completion rates and retention. This product automates that nudge with human-like, personalized messages.

**How it works (3 steps)**
1. You (or your student) complete a lesson or submit a goal in Whop.
2. Zapier calls Gemini 1.5 Pro to generate a short, encouraging message.
3. The message is delivered into that user’s Whop chat (optionally logged to Notion and scheduled as follow-ups).

**Features & Options**
- Personalized 3-sentence messages (under 80 words)
- Optional daily or weekly follow-ups (Looping by Zapier)
- Optional Notion logging (Accountability Logs database)
- Lightweight, no-code setup via Zapier
- Privacy-conscious: you control what data is logged and shared

**Setup time & requirements**
- Estimated setup: 45–90 minutes
- Requires: Whop account with Zapier integration, Zapier account (Starter plan recommended), Google AI Studio API key (Gemini 1.5 Pro), Notion (optional)

**Pricing suggestion**
- Free tier: 1 goal tracked, on-completion message
- $7 / month: Unlimited goals + daily AI check-ins + Notion logging

**ROI angle**
Increase course completion and engagement with minimal overhead. A small monthly fee per user that meaningfully improves retention can pay for itself by increasing course completion-driven upsells and conversions.

**FAQ**
Q: Where is my data stored?
A: Messages are generated via Gemini and delivered through Zapier → Whop. Optional logs are stored only in your Notion workspace if you enable Notion logging.

Q: Can users opt out?
A: Yes — include an opt-out toggle in your product settings or handle a "stop" keyword via a separate Zap that disables follow-ups for the user.

Q: How much does Gemini cost?
A: Gemini API costs depend on your Google AI Studio plan. Monitor usage and consider batching or delaying messages to manage costs.

Q: Is this GDPR/Privacy safe?
A: This automation does not share data publicly. Store only required fields and obtain user consent if storing personal data in Notion.
